<p>The goal is to catch the rabbit with the most effective algorithm. The movement rules are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Players (Hunter and Rabbit) move in turns.</li>
  <li>The game selects Rabbit's hole automatically and you select where the hunter starts his hunt.</li>
  <li>Both players have to move on their turn.</li>
  <li>Rabbit can only move a distance of one hole to either direction on it's turn.</li>
  <li>Hunter moves according to the algorithm specified.</li>
  <li>Neither players can jump "out of the game", meaning if rabbit is in hole the last hole (20), it's next is to hole 19.</li>
  <li>For the hunter the movement direction is reversed.</li>
</ul>
