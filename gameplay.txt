Mode 1:
  Hunter can start wherever he wants (excluding the rabbit hole) and if he reaches either end of the array
  the movement direction changes but possibly messes up the algorithm

Mode 2:
  Hunter starts from the hole 1 and moves in one general direction (algorithm can move back and forth,) but when reaches
  the end without catching rabbit -> game over and lose
